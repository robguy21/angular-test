# Yousemble

## Angular Material Theme Project

Version 4 of Yousemble is moving toward using the Google Material design framework, we will be building new themes for our clients and below is a simple project for building the foundation of those themes.

View the help.html file for insights on Google Material's structure and sytax.

**Project:**

Build 1 or more themes using Angular Material and demonstrate your CSS, JS and design knowledge.

**Requirements:**
- Build 1 or more themes - Only design and build the homepage
- View the /themes folder for the design(s) that need to be built
- Use 1 single [theme-name].html file per theme
- Use dummy menu items for the navigation
- Use the free stock image links below for some content. You can hotlink directly to the images or download them to your project.
- Use dummy text for content
- Structure the HTML in a simple organized manner.
- Track your time spent - We use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/)

Below is simple instructions on how to setup NodeJS, Gulp and Grunt. We'd encourage you to try the setup and code in SASS alowing Gulp to compile or output the CSS. If you're struggling with the setup simply use plain on _vanilla_ CSS in a seperate stylesheet.

## Installing NodeJS
To run Gulp you need to install NodeJS on your machine, click on the link below and run the installer.

## Getting started with Gulp and Sass
Once Node is installed.

Do the following to setup Gulp & SASS on your machine.

1. Navigate to your project folder via the terminal
2. In the terminal type the commands below and hit enter, let it run then do the next one
3. Run "npm init"
4. Run "npm install -g gulp"
5. Run "npm install --save-dev gulp"
6. Run "npm install --save-dev gulp-sass"

Once all the above has been run and completed, you'll see a /node_modules folder has been created in your project folder.

Within your project folder run "gulp" in the terminal and leave it running.

You /sass folder will automatically be watched by Gulp and will listen for any changes made within the /sass folder. Any changes detected within the styles.scss (SASS file) file will be complied and outputted to the /css/styles.css file automatically :)
